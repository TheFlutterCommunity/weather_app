## **Assignment Overview**
In this assignment, I mainly focused on good Project architecture (that helps in project scalability and easy maintenance), state management, modularity, naming convention and optimizations etc.

For developing the Weather App, below main packages are used:
#### **State Management**:
*flutter_bloc*

#### **Dependency Injection**:
*get_it*

#### **Routing**:
*go_router*

#### **API Communication**:
*http, retrofit, dio, build_runner, json_serializable, retrofit_generator*

#### **Local Preferences**:
*shared_preferences*

#### **Local Database**:
*sqflite*

#### **Location**:
*geolocator*

#### **Connectivity**:
*connectivity_plus*

## Note

*Key pointers that are taken care of in this assignment:*

*1. MVVM Architecture*

*2. BLoC State Management*

*3. Coding Standard*

*4. Modular*

*5. Scalable*

*6. Maintainable*

It would be very great if you could share the feedback on it. Does not matter if it is **positive** or **negative** but it will help me to improve myself 
as I have given a good amount of time to complete this assignment using best approach.

Due to not having a proper design tool(Figma, others), I tried to extract information from the given pdf and tried to make it as similar as possible. 


### Important
#### *Using the best approach, Assignment 1 took a good amount of time to complete and as I am working in a company with Sr. Technical Lead Position, it is difficult for me to spare much time from my free time so kindly review the assignment 1 and let me know if you still need assignment 2 for review. Post your confirmation, I will complete and share.* 

#### *It is not about pages like 1-2 pages or 3-4 pages for the assignment, If we use a good architecture, state management and best practices, it always take good time to build a mature system.*
